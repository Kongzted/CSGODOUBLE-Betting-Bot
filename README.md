Due to some recent betting bots scams a statement about this bot:
This is easy to read and always full commented javascript code which explains every single line to understand what it does and why do you need it. *DO NOT* just copy *ANY* code to the console and execute it. This bot is clean and will stay clean. I will try to keep it updated and commented. I am not affiliated with csgodouble.com in any form.
